This project is a certification project for the freeCodeCamp Responsive WebDesign course. 

The instructions for it are as follows

Build a Tribute Page
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

They do go on to give more details of what the project should include, I will let you get those from their site. For my goal, I am going to try to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. I want to build a dual tribute page that showcases the life and work of both Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. Ideally what I want to do is to have the two sitting side by side if the viewport is wide enough, but if it is narrower (like on a phone) then have them stacked vertically.
