            <p>1. **1791**: Born on December 26 in London to a wealthy banking family, providing him the resources to pursue his inventive passions.</p>
            <p>2. **1814**: Graduated from Cambridge and began advocating for mathematical reforms, founding the Analytical Society to modernize notation.</p>
            <p>3. **1822**: Proposed the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator to compute mathematical tables, addressing errors in manual calculations.</p>
            <p>4. **1833**: Demonstrated a prototype of the Difference Engine to Ada Lovelace, initiating their collaboration and her interest in computing machines.</p>
            <p>5. **1834**: Began designing the Analytical Engine, a general-purpose computer with memory, storage, and punched-card programming, a leap beyond the Difference Engine.</p>
            <p>6. **1837**: Developed plans for the Analytical Engine's control flow, including conditional branching, a key feature of modern computers.</p>
            <p>7. **1843**: Saw Ada Lovelace publish her expanded translation of Menabrea's article, praising her visionary notes on the Analytical Engine's potential.</p>
            <p>8. **1847**: Abandoned the Difference Engine due to funding issues, shifting focus to the Analytical Engine, though neither was completed in his lifetime.</p>
            <p>9. **1871**: Died on October 18, leaving behind detailed plans and prototypes that were not fully realized during his life.</p>
            <p>10. **1878**: His son, Henry Prevost Babbage, began constructing parts of the Difference Engine from his father's designs, preserving his legacy.</p>
            <p>11. **1910**: Original drawings and parts of the Analytical Engine were discovered in an attic at Harvard University, inspiring later computer pioneers.</p>
            <p>12. **1937**: Howard Aiken, influenced by Babbage's work, began designing the Harvard Mark I, an early electromechanical computer, linking Babbage's ideas to modern tech.</p>
            <p>13. **1991**: The London Science Museum, led by Doron Swade, completed a full-scale working Difference Engine, proving Babbage's 19th-century designs were feasible.</p>
            <p>14. **2002**: The same team finished a complete Difference Engine, using only materials available to Babbage, validating his engineering genius.</p>
            <p>15. **2011**: Babbage's Analytical Engine plans were recognized as Turing-complete, confirming his role as the “father of the computer.”</p>
            <p>16. **2025**: His legacy continues to influence computer science education, with institutions like the Computer History Museum showcasing his contributions.</p>

            <p>1. **1815**: Born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10 in London, the only legitimate child of Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke, setting the stage for her unique upbringing focused on mathematics.</p>
            <p>2. **1820**: Began showing a fascination with machines, designing conceptual flying machines at age five, which hinted at her later interest in mechanical computation.</p>
            <p>3. **1833**: Met Charles Babbage at age 17 during a party hosted by Mary Somerville, sparking a lifelong collaboration that introduced her to the Difference Engine.</p>
            <p>4. **1835**: Married William King, later Earl of Lovelace, and paused her mathematical studies to focus on family, though she resumed later with Babbage's influence.</p>
            <p>5. **1842**: Translated Luigi Menabrea's French article on the Analytical Engine, adding extensive notes that tripled its length, marking her deep engagement with Babbage's work.</p>
            <p>6. **1843**: Published her notes under the initials “A.A.L.,” including Note G, the first published algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers, establishing her as a pioneer in programming.</p>
            <p>7. **1843**: Envisioned the Analytical Engine manipulating symbols beyond numbers, such as music, anticipating the concept of universal computation a century early.</p>
            <p>8. **1843**: Exchanged detailed letters with Babbage, refining her algorithm and offering to manage the Analytical Engine project, though he declined.</p>
            <p>9. **1848**: Developed ideas for loops and repetitive instructions, laying groundwork for modern programming concepts like iteration.</p>
            <p>10. **1852**: Died of uterine cancer at age 36 on November 27, with her contributions largely unrecognized during her lifetime.</p>
            <p>11. **1953**: Her notes were republished by Bertram Vivian Bowden, sparking renewed interest and recognition as the first computer programmer.</p>
            <p>12. **1979**: The U.S. Department of Defense named the Ada programming language after her, reflecting her lasting influence on software development.</p>
            <p>13. **1980**: The Ada language was officially adopted, becoming widely used in real-time systems like aviation and defense, proving her ideas' practical impact.</p>
            <p>14. **2009**: Ada Lovelace Day was established on the second Tuesday of October to honor women in STEM, cementing her legacy as an inspiration.</p>
            <p>15. **2018**: A first-edition copy of her 1843 notes sold for £95,000 at auction, highlighting the growing value of her historical work.</p>
            <p>16. **2020**: Appeared as a character in “Spyfall, Part 2” of *Doctor Who*, showcasing her cultural impact and continued relevance in popular media.</p>
