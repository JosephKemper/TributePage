16. **2020**: Appeared as a character in “Spyfall, Part 2” of *Doctor Who*, showcasing her cultural impact and continued relevance in popular media.

**Quote About Ada Lovelace**: “The more I read your Notes, the more surprised I am at them and regret not having earlier explored so rich a vein of the noblest metal.” – Charles Babbage, reflecting on her profound insights into the Analytical Engine.

### Facts About Charles Babbage

1. **1791**: Born on December 26 in London to a wealthy banking family, providing him the resources to pursue his inventive passions.
2. **1814**: Graduated from Cambridge and began advocating for mathematical reforms, founding the Analytical Society to modernize notation.
3. **1822**: Proposed the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator to compute mathematical tables, addressing errors in manual calculations.
4. **1833**: Demonstrated a prototype of the Difference Engine to Ada Lovelace, initiating their collaboration and her interest in computing machines.
5. **1834**: Began designing the Analytical Engine, a general-purpose computer with memory, storage, and punched-card programming, a leap beyond the Difference Engine.
6. **1837**: Developed plans for the Analytical Engine’s control flow, including conditional branching, a key feature of modern computers.
7. **1843**: Saw Ada Lovelace publish her expanded translation of Menabrea’s article, praising her visionary notes on the Analytical Engine’s potential.
8. **1847**: Abandoned the Difference Engine due to funding issues, shifting focus to the Analytical Engine, though neither was completed in his lifetime.
9. **1871**: Died on October 18, leaving behind detailed plans and prototypes that were not fully realized during his life.
10. **1878**: His son, Henry Prevost Babbage, began constructing parts of the Difference Engine from his father’s designs, preserving his legacy.
11. **1910**: Original drawings and parts of the Analytical Engine were discovered in an attic at Harvard University, inspiring later computer pioneers.
12. **1937**: Howard Aiken, influenced by Babbage’s work, began designing the Harvard Mark I, an early electromechanical computer, linking Babbage’s ideas to modern tech.
13. **1991**: The London Science Museum, led by Doron Swade, completed a full-scale working Difference Engine, proving Babbage’s 19th-century designs were feasible.
14. **2002**: The same team finished a complete Difference Engine, using only materials available to Babbage, validating his engineering genius.
15. **2011**: Babbage’s Analytical Engine plans were recognized as Turing-complete, confirming his role as the “father of the computer.”
16. **2025**: His legacy continues to influence computer science education, with institutions like the Computer History Museum showcasing his contributions.

**Quote About Charles Babbage**: “He was probably the most original and fertile inventive genius of the 19th century.” – Alfred North Whitehead, acknowledging Babbage’s groundbreaking engineering vision.

### What’s Happening and Why

- **During Their Lives**: Lovelace and Babbage collaborated on the Analytical Engine, with Lovelace’s notes providing the first algorithm and a vision of universal computation, while Babbage’s designs introduced programmable machinery. Their work was theoretical due to funding and technical limitations, but it established foundational concepts.
- **After Their Deaths**: The rediscovery of Babbage’s plans and the construction of the Difference Engine proved his designs’ viability, influencing pioneers like Aiken. Lovelace’s notes, rediscovered in 1953, inspired the Ada language and her recognition as a programming pioneer, shaping software development and promoting women in STEM.
- **Impact on Modern Programming**: Babbage’s punched-card system and memory concepts prefigure modern hardware, while Lovelace’s algorithms and vision of symbolic manipulation underpin software versatility, from loops to artificial intelligence.
