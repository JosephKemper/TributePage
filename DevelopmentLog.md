I gave my first attempt at getting the two column structure in. For now, I just got the dates and facts put in, to give me something to work with, and it did not work. I am kind of not surprized though, the thing I am trying to build my idea from was from an image gallary. 

### What I Tried

When examining the Build a Photo galary project, I noticed that they used flexbox applied to a container that held all the images. For now, I just took the dates and put them in a p element unformatted, and then used the same code I wrote for the Photo Galary and created a temporary class to try to see what happens. 

### Next Steps

I think the first problem I need to solve is the things I am planning to turn into stackable columns are too wide. I need to put a maximum width to each column and then make sure the text wraps.
